# CS50W Capstone project requirements:

&nbsp;

## Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

The project was made from scratch, based on an original idea, following the requirements and trying to implement all methods learned through the lectures and problem sets.

## Whatâ€™s contained in each file you created.

  - `/movieclub_project/movieclub/static/movieclub` contains all javascript and css files.

  - `/movieclub_project/movieclub/templates/movieclub` contains all .html files.

All files created and used in the project are described in the [Features](#features) section, with the exception of the following, used more generally:

  - `image.js` used to frame images when reframing was needed.

  - `style.css` used to store all the css specifications.

  - `apology.html` used to return an apology page with specified error message when needed.

## How to run your application.

Described in [Instalation](#instalation) section.

## Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
Some observations:
- The project allows (and requires, initially) manually adding each movie to it's database.
- `models.py` allows to implement an ___User.avatar___ and a ___Movie.poster___, providing the image url, but this feature is not enabled by default. To change it's default values, it is needed to access Django's admin interface via `/admin`.
